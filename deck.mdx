# What is Thinkful?

```notes
Hey guys, in this video, I want to talk about Thinkful,
the coding bootcamp that I graduated and helped me launch my programming career.
```

---

## Disclaimers

```notes
Before we go on, I want to clarify few things.

1. I'm not affiliated what-so-ever with Thinkful, this content was created purely out of my own interest.
Therefore, I'm going to be very honest about my review of the program.

2. I've graduated from the program about 2 years ago.
So, please understand that some of the things I say might be outdated.
I do know that the overall structure hasn't changed much (because it's proven to work for many cases)

3. Because I did not take all of their programs, I do have limited scope based on my experience. Please be advised.

I'm going to go through questions on the screen that I hand-picked
from the numerous Q&A sessions that I did at my workshop.
```

## Who am I?

```notes
Okay, for those who doesn't know me, My name is Sean.
I took Thinkful's program back in mid 2016 and graduated in 4 months.
I got my first programming job within 2 months of graduation. I've been working as a software engineer for over 2 years
I'm basically this guy on the website (search). If you want to know more about me please check it out.

## What is a coding bootcamp?

A career accelerator

```notes
A coding bootcamp is basically a career accelerator that takes you from a non-programming profession to
an entry-level programming job.
It it NOT designed to take you from 0 to mastery in programming.
I don't believe there's such thing, let alone in few months.
```

---

## Why did I choose Thinkful?

1. Job guarantee
2. 100% online school
3. 1-on-1 mentorship
4. Built by their own engineers

```notes
First of all, they provided a job guarantee. What this is, if you don't get a job within 6 months of graduating
(and you follow every instructions you wered told),
you get 100% tuition back guaranteed. I liked this option,
because it made me feel more safe financially and psychologically.
It made me feel like they were confident enough (about their own program) to offer something like this.

Second, Thinkful is 100% online school. Most people tend to gravitate towards off-line schools and I personally disagree.
I think all the commutes, socializing, just even getting-yourself-ready-in-the-morning can be a source of distraction.
My remote pair-programming experience was no different from local pair-programming
(in fact, I found to be better sometimes).
I also like the fact, they started off as online-school meaning
I wasn't going to be discriminated because I'm taking their online version.
Some schools offer off-line vs. online and their off-line versions are way better (because that's how they started).

1-on-1 mentorship is something that Thinkful offers which I highly value.
Your learning curve initially can be very steep because you are coming from a different background.
These mentors (who has many years of experience in the field) can help you to learn faster.

Lastly (this is my personal preference),
I respect that they built their own course materials using the tools they are teaching.
I'm talking about the instructor video chat, support feed, course content, basically everything you see.
They were engineers themselves and the school built by actual engineers is something I could trust on.
```

## What programs does Thinkful offer?

1. Full-time (Engineering Immersion) vs. Flex (Full Stack Flex) Web Development

- Engineering Nights & Weekends (Web Development?)

2. Data Science

```notes
Thinkful has changed a bit since last time I graduated, but their core categories remain similar.
It's basically full-time vs. flexible for web development,
and they have separate programs for all the data-related subjects.
I think the new program called "Engineering Nights & Weekends" falls between Full-time vs Flex.
Unfortunately, I don't know much about this program (as well as the data one).
```

---

## How are these programs (Full vs Flex) different?

1. Same course materials and 1-on-1 mentorship
2. Expensive (Full) vs. Cheaper (Flex)
3. Classroom (Full) vs. Solo (Flex)

```notes
Essentially, both have exactly same course materials and 1-on-1 mentorship. But, one is more expensive than the other.
Why? because Full version is like an actual classroom.
You can't take it unless you quit your job (maybe not the new program? Engineering Nights?)

(Go to website), this is what the typical schedule looks like.
You have actual instructors, TA's, and group of other students you are taking the course with
(this entire group is called a cohort).
Most projects, you work together with cohort students to come up with solutions together.

On the other hand, flex is literally more flexible. You move at your own pace.
If you think all the group work is going to slow you down (and you prefer saving money + not quitting job),
this program is for you.
```

## What program did I take? and why?

Full-time (Engineering Immersion) Web Development

- Rigid structure
- Get better at communicating
- Could not work and code

```notes
I wanted more rigid studying structure. I mean, now I can self-learn because of what I learned from Thinkful,
but back then I couldn't.
I wanted teachers and programs telling me what to do at what specific time so I won't lose focus or get distracted.

As you guys might know, I'm not a native English speaker, so I wanted to get better at communicating.
Especially, at talking my code to someone.
I knew that these pair-programming practices would eventually help me for upcoming interviews.

Lastly, I simply could not work (doing Chemistry) and come home to code.
I tried self-study for few months in 2015 and it made me actually hate my job.
I felt bad for my coworkers, so I decided to quit and take the bootcamp full-time.
```

## How long did it take? How to endure?

4 months for me (5 months now)

Preview > Review

```notes
I started in June 6, 2016 and ended on October 7th, 2016. So, exactly 4 months.
I don't know whether one of us complained it was too fast (lol?), but now it's 5 months long.

One tip I want to give is, do more preview than review.
This is what usually happens among the beginners.
They somehow think that a bootcamp can take them from 0 to mastery in programming.
So, they try to absorb every single information 200% everyday, and choke on the day 3 because they over-study jQuery.
It's better to be content with 70% (rough idea) of knowledge and preview the next day.
Full-time program is going to feel like drinking a water out of a fire-hose.
You have to accept the fact that some water's just going to drip out.
```

## Getting the most of 1-on-1 mentorship

Ask questions that Google won't easily answer

```notes
You are assigned a mentor throughout your program.
These people have been in the industry for many many years. You get couple of mentor sessions per week.
You don't want to ask him/her something like
'how to center a div in css' because that you can search for that instantly on Google.

Instead, ask something you'll only learn during your mentor session.
I asked my mentor (Jason Humphrey, a great guy! be sure to check him out)
about how he does debugging when he runs into a problem.
He showed me and, to this day, I still use the same technique at my work.
```

---

## After Graduation: Career Service

Seperate team for career service

```notes
Not sure if they still have this. But, this was one of my favorite part of Thinkful.
The moment you graduate, you are assigned a career service team.
These people are professionals who's going to help you until you get a job in tech field.
You have daily standups with your career mentor (different from your programing mentor),
\and you have to keep up with job hunting program for next 6 months.
Most people (based on what I saw) do meet their goal.
I haven't seen anyone who had to get the job guarantee money back (even after 6 months of trying).
You also get resume, cover-letter, portfolio, interview coaching from the team.
So, use everything you can to get the job.
```

## Do interviewers know about Thinkful?

No. Most don't even know what bootcamp is.

```notes
Unfortunately, this is the sad reality. You pay thousands of dollars,
but bootcamp industry is still small compared to the rest. Most people don't know yet.
When I was interviewing, I had to explain multiple times what Thinkful is and what I did while there.
(I mean, things might have changed past 2 years)

But, that's also where your advantage is. Interviewers can't have prejudice towards something they don't know.
You can elaborate your experience however you like.
(On my resume) I made my Thinkful experience kind of sound like I was actually working in tech, building projects.
I didn't lie, but I didn't straight up said
"I only have 4 months of programming experience and these are things I built in my coding school"
The point is... don't downgrade yourself intentionally.
```

## Would you recommend Thinkful?

- Yes - if you can invest and are short on time
- No - if you think that Thinkful will solve everything

```notes
Finally, would I recommend this program?
Absolutely for those who's willing to invest money, effort, and also running out of time.
However, I don't think this program is for you, if you think somehow Thinkful is going to take care of everything.
Outside of 40 hours you spend on program per week, you still have to contribute many hours just to keep up.
Paying thousands of dollars does not justify success. It's really up to you to make it happen.

I think that's all I wanted to talk about.
If you have any more questions, please leave comments below. I'll be sure to answer them the best I can. Thanks guys.
